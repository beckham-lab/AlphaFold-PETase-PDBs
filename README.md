### Model structures of PET-hydrolases with AlphaFold

This repository contains AlphaFold model structures derived by the DeepMind team for active and putative PET-hydrolases that are presented in the paper:

Erickson E, Gado JE, Avilan L, *et al*. **Sourcing thermotolerant poly(ethylene terephthalate) hydrolase scaffolds from natural diversity**. *Nature Catalysis*, 2022. [Insert DOI Link](https://www.nature.com/natcatal/)

The enzymes are named according to their phylogenetic groupings (Group 1: 101, 102, etc., Group2: 201, 202, etc) and the structure files for each enzyme denote models derived with different random seeds (PETcan101_0, PETcan102_1, etc.). Different random seeds do not result in signficantly different structures for compact folds, but there may be greater differences in awkward structures.

Additional biochemical and structural data for these enzymes can be found in the paper.
